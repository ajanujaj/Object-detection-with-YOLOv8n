# Object-detection-with-YOLOv8n
Employing YOLOv8 for image analysis, it adeptly distinguishes individuals wearing or without masks on their faces. This robust detection system accurately processes images, making it valuable for applications like health monitoring and compliance tracking.


## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle. You can download it from the following link: [Face Mask Detection YOLOv5](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepakat002/face-mask-detection-yolov5).
